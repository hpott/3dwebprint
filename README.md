## How it works
Users upload files to the web interface for printing, and the admin logs in, downloads the files and prints them. Through the website admins can add, delete or see details of uploaded files.

## Usage
``python3 ./main.py``

**Default admin credentials are 'admin' and 'password'**

## Installation
1. Install ``python3`` and ``python3-pip``
2. Run ``pip3 install flask``
